# sentiment_classifier

reviews.py uses the IMDB file as the data set. The code implements several different machine learning algorithms, but I encourage you to try it out for yourself to narrow down
which models you prefer. In general, I recommend using the Support Vector Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Nearest Centroid and Logistic Regression. All parameters
have been fine tuned using GridSearchCV, but once again I encourage you to try to make it more accurate using other tests.
